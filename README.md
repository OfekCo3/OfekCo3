## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate from **The Academic College of Tel Aviv–Yaffo (Honors Program)**,  
with hands-on experience building **production-grade backend systems**, mentoring developers, and shipping real products used by real users.
I enjoy working close to the core of the system — architecture, APIs, async processing, data flows — and taking ownership end-to-end.
